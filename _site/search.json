      "contents": "\r\nThe fictitious Kronos Incident saw the disappearance of several employees from the Tethys-based GASTech in January 2014 after a successful initial public offering (IPO) of the company. Given that GASTech has not been very environmentally friendly in its operations of a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it was suspected that a Kronos-based organisation (POK) is involved in the disappearance of the employees, as a form of retaliation. In order to have a better idea on what exactly transpired to lead to the vanishing of the GASTech employees, we will be applying visual analytical techniques on the datasets provided.\r\nThis study will be handling visualisations on newspaper articles, employee records and emails, call center reports and microblog tweets before structuring them into an interactive web application. Users can then investigate the application and understand more about GASTech’s reputation. Furthermore, one can navigate around the app to find out how certain events unfolded on the incident day itself.\r\nThe interactive Shiny app aims to provide information on:\r\nMedia portrayal of GASTech over the years\r\nRelationships among GASTech, POK, the APA and Government\r\nMeaningful event reports during the incident day\r\nRisks identified during the incident day and their corresponding locations\r\nexplain literature review. Why this is better than the 2014 challenge\r\nWill summarise and add in later >.<\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It provides information of the type of reputation and relations the company has had over the years with the citizens of Kronos and the protesters of “POK” in general.\r\n2.1 Text Analysis\r\nInsights on the news paper articles published from the start of establishment of the company in Kronons all the way to the year of the incident can be drawn from this section. It involves a lot of text data being visualized and cluster analysis.\r\n2.1.1 Comparison Cloud of Articles\r\nThis is a comparison word cloud of newspaper articles that were published over the years that GAStech company has been established. The differences in the type of content written across various newspaper groups can be visualized.\r\n [1] Select the type of data to populate the cloud. Content represents the words within the articles and title are the titles of articles.\r\n[2] One or more number of newspaper groups can be selected from the dropdown list of all news groups available to compare the articles of those newspapers.\r\n2.1.2 Cluster Analysis\r\nThis clustering is a “TextNet” that identifies those newsgroups that are similar based on the type of words they use. The darker the edge, the more similar those newsgroups are. All the newspaper groups that we have are segregated into 6 clusters overall.\r\n\r\n[1] Select the number of edges a node should have to visualize only those node names.\r\n[2] Select the cluster group number to view the newspaper groups in that cluster more clearly.\r\n2.1.3 Word Co-occurrence\r\nThis visualization is a “Text Plot” that shows the collections of word pair and how frequent these word pairs occur represented by the thickness of the edges between these words. The thicker the edge, the more frequently those words are used together.\r\n [1] Select the cluster number to view those word that are commonly used together.\r\n[2] Enter the number of word pars to display.\r\n[3] Select checkbox to view “Bigram plot” for a more detailed understanding of which words comes first the which word follows.\r\nUpon selecting the checkbox,\r\n\r\n[4] Enter the number of times the phrases should occur for them to appear on the plot.\r\n2.1.4 Correlation of Newsgroups\r\nIn this tab, the correlation value of the newsgroups can be identified. Previously we have seen which newsgroups are similar and how they have been clustered but, in this tab, we can visualize the correlation value between them.\r\n [1] Select the range of correlation value.\r\n[2] Select the checkbox to view word clouds of two different newsgroups and compare how similar or different they are.\r\nUpon selecting the checkbox,\r\n\r\n[3] Select the first newspaper group from the dropdown to visualize its word cloud.\r\n[4] Select the number of words to be visualized in the first word cloud.\r\n[5] Select the second newsgroup.\r\n[6] Select the number of words to be visualized in the second word cloud.\r\n2.2 Network Graph\r\nUnder this sub section, insights on employees working within the GAStech company can be extracted. It consists of both the official and unofficial emails sent across the company 2 weeks before the incident. The behavior of employees within these 2 weeks can provide vital information in this investigation.\r\n2.2.1 Relationships\r\nThis tab shows the network of work-related emails and non-work-related emails exchanged across all employees. The employees are represented by nodes and the thickness of edges represents the number of emails exchanged between the two nodes. The thicker the edge, the greater number of emails exchanged.\r\n [1] Select the type of email network to visualize.\r\n[2] Select any type of identification of the nodes from the dropdown list.\r\n2.2.2 Flow of Emails\r\nThe traffic of emails that were exchanged in the 2 weeks can be split into the date they were sent or the weekday. This is useful to identify the day where there were most emails exchanged across the GAStech company.\r\n [1] Select the distribution of emails across the 2 weeks\r\n[2] Select the checkbox to zoom in the emails exchanged on a specific date\r\nUpon selecting the checkbox,\r\n\r\n[3] Select any one date from the dropdown list\r\n[4] Select the mode of identifying the nodes(employees)\r\n[5] Check the checkbox to display the names of the employees represented by the nodes\r\n2.2.3 Target Employee\r\nThis tab focuses not on the whole company but rather on a single employee. It provides insights on the close associates to an employee and how frequently does the employee associates to other employees.\r\n\r\n[1] Select the employee from the dropdown list of all employees in GAStech company.\r\n[2] Select the identification of the nodes.\r\n3 On the Day of Incident\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

By focusing on the top few, we can see if some authors are producing spam that will interfere with the downstream sense-making of the data.\r\n\r\nThe graph on top shows the authors and their messages over time, grouped by each hour.\r\n[1] Based on the graph, select any author to explore the content of their messages.\r\n3.1.2 Word Cloud\r\nWe make use of simple wordclouds to get an overview of the kind of topics and keywords that are most often discussed in the message stream.\r\n\r\n[1] Select the minimum wordcount / term frequency for a word to be included in the the wordcloud. If we want less words in the wordcloud, choose a higher value; if we want more words, choose a lower value.\r\n[2] Select the size of the wordcloud.\r\n[3] Select the wordcloud type. The default one uses a single wordcloud for the whole period. We can also choose the multiple wordcloud, which provides one wordcloud for each hour.\r\n\r\n3.1.3 TF-IDF Keywords\r\nThe third part utilizes the TF-IDF heuristic, which measures how important a word is to a document in a collection/corpus of documents, by including the inverse document frequency (IDF) to balance the term frequency (TF) used in the wordcloud. Therefore, it allows us to sieve out the most important events happening in each period from the chatter spread throughout the dataset.\r\n\r\n[1] Select the plot type. The default one calculates tf-idf for bigrams (word pairs), which provides more context and is thus easier to interpret for the user. The user can also choose to see the unigram (single words) tf-idf plot, as show below.\r\n\r\n[2] Change the top N bigrams/unigrams by tf-idf value to be shown.\r\n[3] Choose whether to show the data table of the message stream. This is useful if we need more context surrounding specific keywords, which can be done by searching for these keywords in the message stream. An example is shown below with the “alexandrias ithakis” keywords (which is a cross junction of two roads, Alexandrias and Ithakis).\r\n\r\n3.2 Risk level timeline\r\nThis section looks at how the level of the risk to the public evolves over the course of the incident unfolding, and uses various measures to explore this risk.\r\n3.2.1 By Call Centre Reports\r\nThis tab looks at the call centre reports, which are organized, low in numbers and have a high signal-to-noise ratio (compared to microblog messages).\r\n\r\n[1] Select the time intervals to bin the messages. This allows flexibility to group the messages into different desired time intervals, to explore the timeline as desired. An example is shown using 5 min intervals instead of the default 15 min interval.\r\n\r\n[2] Choose whether to only include call centre reports that are longer in length. This is because long messages tend to be more important incidents, due to the need to report more incident details. An example is shown below when including all messages, which tends to introduce more minor reports to the timeline.\r\n\r\n[3] Choose whether to include the data table, to see the details of the reports.\r\n3.2.2 By Microblog Messages\r\nThis tab looks at the microblog messages. While more messy and noisy, they contain significant information like crowd levels and public reactions to add to the risk level evaluation. We use various quantitative estimates to assess risk.\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n[2]\r\n[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
